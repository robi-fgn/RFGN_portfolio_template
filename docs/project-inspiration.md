## Theme Draft

The overall project seeks a retromodernism vibe that mixes a modern pop of colour and glassmorphism with a retro gallery layout, thick borders, chunky blocks, etc. Although this works for any kind of content, mixed-media creators are the perfect audience as the mix of traditional and digital arts works perfectly with the look of the website.

Through these set of elements, the genres that work best for the images used for each project are neo-mixed media, editorial products and texturized illustration, especially in black-n-white, earthy and red tones. Many other styles work out perfectly too, but these are ones I'm prioritizing for the development of the web.
