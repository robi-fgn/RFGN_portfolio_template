## Project Concept

### What are you building?

<!-- Describe your project in 2-3 sentences -->

I'm creeating a potfolio website template that can be customised to a creative's liking. The objective is to make it visually appealing while prioritising it's usability and adaptability for other people to customize it.

### Who is it for?

<!-- Define your target audience -->

Mainly for creatives who have a wide variety of projects from different artistic disciplines and would make the most of a gallery-style website. The multidisciplinary essence of the gallery stays coherent with the website, which maintains a modern but traditional overall style. This aspect can vary a lot by changing the images used.

### Why does it matter?

<!-- Explain the purpose and value of your project -->

This website has the potential to be adapted and changed into a variety of different styles. The thick borders and beige background are what provide a retro feeling, but the use of images and text/section customization is what make it possible for each person to tailor it into their own style and truly shape the web.

In a project that could be used by so many people, I valued it's visual potential to be adapted and changed.

## Design Direction

### Visual Style

<!-- Describe your aesthetic approach -->

The style chosen for this project was retro modernism. The elements used in the website use thick borders and a color palette that conveys the retro feeling. Other aspects like the red accent color, glassmorphism effect and typography help to take the retro vibe into a retro-modernism level, although the imagery chosen is what really sets the tone for the web.

### Color Palette

<!-- List your main colors -->

The main color palette covers a broken black and white vibe where off-white, off-black and beige tones are used for ambience and pure black and white elements stand out (mainly typography and borders). Red is used as an accent tone that can be seen both in the projects and throughout the website.

Main colors:

- Beige
- Black
- Red

### Typography

<!-- What fonts/typeface approach will you use? -->

Typographically, EB Garamond helped acquire the retro effect while Caprasimo leaned towards the more modern aspect of the website. Despite this, both typographies are serif and show similarities between each other. This mix works out nicely as they complement each other in a display-text font dynamic.

### Inspiration/References

## Reflection Questions

### What excites you most about this project?

Mainly the fact that it may be my future portfolio as I really like the final aspect it has, but also the potential of optimizing the CSS (especially for the red color to be easily changed) aand maybe gaining some money from sharing the template and even customizing it for other people.

### What challenges do you anticipate?

As I already said, I want to optimize the css classes for colors, and I can already imagine that having images stored locally might not be the best option for the future deployment of the website, so I may have to look into other alternatives.

I also lack a lot of knowledge on coding so I may need some help from the AI to troubleshoot future problems. Despite this, I'm excited to keep working on this template and finish the "about" and "contact me" sections, which I couldn't get to on time but I know will be simpler and probably easier to make.

### How does this project connect to your learning goals?

I have been able to better understand CDNs and certain aspects of the technologies I used, which I had a hard time understanding during classes. I can definitely say I have a hard time grasping some aspects of web design and coding, but despite this I'm glad that I could pull off a project in this discipline.
